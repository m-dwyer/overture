# Schwung Framework — dAVEBOx Limitations & Lessons

Practical lessons learned building dAVEBOx within the Schwung framework. Complements
CLAUDE.md (which documents what's built); this document explains *why* things are
built the way they are and what to watch for in future work.

## 1. JS Mirror (`clipSteps`) Can Diverge From DSP State

`clipSteps[t][c][s]` is the JS-side model of what's in each step. It is populated
from DSP `get_param` calls and updated optimistically after `set_param` commands.

**The divergence problem**: `_steps` returns the *display position* of each note
(midpoint-based: `(tick + 12) / 24 % len`), not the *data position* (which slot
owns the note). When a note is nudged past a step's midpoint, `_steps` reports it
in the adjacent step even though the data still lives in the original slot.

When `pollDSP` re-reads `_steps` while a step is held, it populates `clipSteps`
with display positions. This means:
- `clipSteps[dstStep]` gets set to 1 even though `dstStep` has no data
- Tap-toggle on that step sees `wasOn=true` and sends a deactivate command to an
  empty DSP slot — data corruption
- Any guard like `if (clipSteps[dst] === 0)` checking "is destination empty" fails

**Pattern that works**: while a step is held and the poll is updating `clipSteps`
for live preview, do not use `clipSteps` as the authoritative data model. After
release, fire a deferred re-read (`pendingStepsReread`) to resync the mirror from
the ground truth (DSP).

**Opportunity**: a dedicated `displaySteps` buffer separate from `clipSteps` would
cleanly separate "where notes fire" (display) from "where data lives" (editing).
The current approach uses the same array for both, which requires careful management
of when each meaning is in effect.

---

## 2. Hold-vs-Tap Disambiguation: `stepBtnPressedTick` Is Cleared Before Release

When the hold threshold fires (~200ms), the hold detection code sets
`stepBtnPressedTick[heldStepBtn] = -1` to close the tap window. The button release
event fires later — but at that point, `stepBtnPressedTick` is already `-1` for
*both* the tap path (cleared inside the tap branch) and the hold path (cleared at
threshold). You cannot check `stepBtnPressedTick >= 0` at release time to determine
which path occurred.

**The fix**: a separate boolean `stepWasHeld` set to `true` only when the hold
threshold fires. Cleared on press and on all step-cancel paths. The release handler
checks `stepWasHeld` to determine if the hold path occurred.

**Generalizes**: any logic that must run "only on hold-release, not tap-release"
needs its own flag. The timing of `stepBtnPressedTick` makes it unusable for this
purpose at release time.

---

## 3. `set_param` Is Fire-and-Forget; Confirmation Requires a Subsequent Tick

`host_module_set_param` sends to the DSP audio thread asynchronously. There is no
return value or acknowledgment. A `get_param` call in the *same* JS tick reads
pre-set_param state (the audio thread hasn't processed it yet).

**Pattern for confirmation**: optimistic local update + deferred re-read.
1. Apply the change optimistically to the JS mirror (e.g. `clipSteps[src] = 0`)
2. Send `set_param` (e.g. `_reassign`)
3. Set `pendingStepsReread = 2` (2-tick countdown)
4. When countdown reaches 0, do `get_param("_steps")` and overwrite the mirror

The 2-tick delay ensures the audio thread has processed the command before JS reads
back the result. A 1-tick delay is usually sufficient but 2 is safer under load.

**Corollary**: `pendingDspSync` (5 ticks after `state_load`) follows the same
pattern but uses a longer delay because state load is heavier than a single command.

---

## 4. Multi-Field Operations Must Be Expressed as One Atomic DSP Command

The coalescing constraint (last `set_param` per JS tick wins) means a sequence of
JS `set_param` calls that logically form one operation will drop all but the last.
Worse: `pollDSP` runs every 4 ticks and restores stale JS-side state from DSP
between calls, so even across ticks, JS reading back partial state during a
multi-step JS-driven sequence sees inconsistent results.

**The rule**: any operation that must atomically modify multiple DSP fields should
be implemented as a single DSP command (like `_reassign`, `tN_pfx_reset`, `panic`,
`deactivate_all`). Do not try to build atomic multi-field operations from sequences
of JS `set_param` calls.

**Example that failed before `_reassign` existed**: trying to move step data by
doing `set_param(_clear, src)` + `set_param(_toggle, dst, note)` across ticks —
the render thread fires between ticks and could play notes from the wrong state.

---

## 5. `clip_migrate_to_notes` Is the Synchronization Point

The DSP maintains two representations of clip data:
- Step arrays (`step_notes`, `step_note_count`, `note_tick_offset`, `steps`) — the
  editing model; addressed by step index
- `notes[]` array — the absolute-position playback model; addressed by absolute tick

Every `set_param` command that modifies step arrays must call `clip_migrate_to_notes`
at the end to rebuild `notes[]` from the step data. Missing this call leaves `notes[]`
stale and playback will not reflect the edit.

All existing DSP commands (`_toggle`, `_add`, `_clear`, `_reassign`, etc.) call it.
Any new DSP command that touches step data must also call it.

**Direction of truth**: step arrays → `notes[]` (one-way rebuild). Never modify
`notes[]` directly; always go through step arrays. The exception is the recording
path which appends to `notes[]` directly for performance, then calls
`clip_build_steps_from_notes` (the reverse) at specific points.

---

## 6. `steps[s] == 0` No Longer Means "No Data"

Before Phase K (inactive steps), the invariant was: `steps[s] == 1` iff
`step_note_count[s] >= 1`. Code throughout the DSP used `if (!cl->steps[sidx]) return`
as a guard meaning "nothing here, ignore."

After Phase K, a step can have `step_note_count[s] > 0` with `steps[s] == 0`
(inactive-with-notes = dark gray LED). Guards that used `!steps[sidx]` as "empty"
will silently skip inactive steps and prevent editing them.

**The correct guard** for "nothing to act on" is:
```c
if (cl->step_note_count[sidx] == 0) return;
```

Any new DSP command operating on step data should use this guard. The `steps[sidx]`
field now means only "will this step generate MIDI output" — not "does data exist."

---

## 7. `notes[]` Tombstones Accumulate; `note_count` Doesn't Shrink on Removal

When a note is removed (via `_toggle`, `_clear`, etc.), its slot in `notes[]` is
tombstoned (`active = 0`) but `note_count` is not decremented — the slot is not
reclaimed. `clip_migrate_to_notes` rebuilds `notes[]` from scratch (which does
reclaim all tombstones), but individual note removals accumulate tombstones until
the next full rebuild.

`MAX_NOTES_PER_CLIP = 512`. A clip with 256 steps × 8 notes = 2048 logical slots,
but the hard ceiling of 512 means fully dense clips are only possible up to ~64
active steps. In practice, `clip_migrate_to_notes` is called after every step edit,
so tombstones are reclaimed frequently. But be aware:
- Heavy recording passes accumulate tombstones in `notes[]` faster than rebuilds
- If `note_count` approaches 512, `clip_insert_note` silently fails
- The recording path appends directly to `notes[]` without calling `clip_migrate_to_notes`
  (deferred for performance); flush is triggered at disarm

---

## 8. The O(N) Render Scan

The note-centric playback model scans all `note_count` entries in `notes[]` every
render tick per track. At 8 tracks × 512 notes/track × ~196 ticks/second = ~800K
iterations/second worst case (assuming fully dense clips on all tracks).

This is fine at current scale. The `occ_cache` 256-bit occupancy bitmap was added
but is currently used only in recording occupancy checks, not to short-circuit the
render scan. If performance becomes a concern, using `occ_cache` to skip the scan
for clips with no note at the current tick would reduce this significantly.

---

## 9. `_steps` Display Position vs Data Position — The Midpoint Formula

`_steps` reports which step each note "belongs to" for display purposes using the
midpoint formula: `step = (tick + TICKS_PER_STEP/2) / TICKS_PER_STEP % length`.

At `TICKS_PER_STEP = 24`: `step = (tick + 12) / 24 % length`.

A note at tick `T` is displayed in step `S` if `S*24 - 12 <= T < S*24 + 12`. This
means a note at tick 11 (just before midpoint of step 0) shows in step 0, but a
note at tick 13 (just past midpoint) shows in step 1 — even though the data slot is
still step 0 in both cases.

**Implication**: `_steps` is the right source of truth for "where should this step
LED light up" but is unreliable for "which step slot do I send edit commands to."
For editing, the step slot index from the press event (or `heldStep`) is the correct
address — not what `_steps` says.

---

## 10. `midi_inject_to_move` From set_param Context Does Not Release Move Synth Voices

`midi_inject_to_move` can be called from two contexts: the render_block audio thread
and set_param (the Schwung param-dispatch thread). Both calls write into the inject
SHM ring successfully — the ring accepts the packet regardless of which thread called.
However, **Move's voice allocator only acts on inject packets that arrive from the
render_block (audio thread) context**. Packets injected from set_param context are
received by Move but do not cause it to release held voices.

**Observed symptom**: note-offs injected in stop/panic handlers reach the ring
(`inject=1, sent=N` in log) but ROUTE_MOVE synth voices continue sounding.

**The correct pattern for ROUTE_MOVE note-offs on stop/panic**:
1. Call `silence_track_notes_v2` — uses `pfx_note_off`, which queues note-offs into
   `fx->events[]` (with `fire_at` set to a future sample count) and clears `active_notes`.
2. Reschedule all queued events to fire immediately: `events[i].fire_at = fx->sample_counter`.
3. Do NOT clear `event_count` — let `pfx_q_fire` drain the queue in the next render_block.
4. Skip ROUTE_MOVE tracks in `send_panic`: the 128-note flood would overflow the inject
   ring (64 packets, drains at 8/SPI tick) and most note-offs would be lost anyway.

`pfx_q_fire` runs unconditionally in render_block *before* the `if (!inst->playing) return`
guard, so it drains the queue even when transport is stopped.

**Contrast with ROUTE_SCHWUNG**: `midi_send_internal` works correctly from any context,
so SCHWUNG tracks can clear `event_count` and send via `send_panic` as before.

**Related**: the inject SHM ring holds 64 packets and drains at 8 packets per SPI tick
(~2.9ms). `send_panic`'s 128-note × 4-track = 512 inject packets would take ~187ms to
drain and most would be silently dropped if the ring fills.

---

## 11. Live Note Flush Coalescing With Step Toggle set_params

When a step button is pressed or released, a `pendingLiveNotes` flush (to silence any
held pad notes) can be dispatched in the same JS tick as a step-toggle `set_param`.
Due to the coalescing rule (last set_param per tick wins), the step toggle is dropped.

**Symptom**: toggling a step activates/deactivates multiple other steps in a seemingly
random pattern (the live-note flush overwrites the intended toggle, and the DSP acts on
stale step state).

**Fix**: set `stepOpTick = tickCount` at both step press and step release. The flush
guard checks `tickCount !== stepOpTick` before dispatching, preventing the flush from
sharing a tick with any step-button event.

---

## 12. Cable-2 Echo Cascade — ROUTE_MOVE Live External MIDI Input

### What happens

In overtake mode, Move passes cable-2 (external USB-A MIDI) through to its native
track instruments AND echoes every cable-2 event it receives back on MIDI_OUT cable-2.
The shim delivers MIDI_OUT cable-2 to `onMidiMessageExternal`. This means:

- A note from a keyboard plugged into USB-A arrives in `onMidiMessageExternal`
- If dAVEBOx injects that note back to Move (to remap the channel), Move echoes the
  inject on MIDI_OUT cable-2
- `onMidiMessageExternal` fires again → another inject → another echo → ∞ cascade
- The cascade fills the 64-packet inject SHM ring within milliseconds → crash

### Why the refcount approach fails

The natural fix is a per-pitch inject-echo refcount: increment on inject, decrement
when the echo arrives, drop the echo. This does not work reliably because:

- MIDI_OUT has only 20 slots per SPI frame
- Cable-0 hardware events (pads, buttons, LEDs) routinely consume 11+ of those slots
- When MIDI_OUT is full, cable-2 echoes are silently dropped
- Dropped echoes mean the refcount never decrements → refcount leaks → subsequent
  real keyboard presses are treated as echoes and dropped

This is documented in `~/schwung-docs/MIDI_INJECTION.md` as a known-broken pattern.

### The fix (current dAVEBOx behaviour)

Never inject in `onMidiMessageExternal` for ROUTE_MOVE tracks. Move's native
cable-2 passthrough plays keyboard notes on whatever Move track has a matching
MIDI In channel — no dAVEBOx involvement needed. The `liveSendNote` call is guarded
by `if (!routeIsMove)` for all message types (note-on, note-off, CC/AT/PB).

Pad notes still inject (they are cable-0 events; Move does not auto-route them to
track instruments in overtake mode). The sequencer injects from DSP `render_block`
context, which is unaffected.

### Consequence: no channel remapping for live external MIDI

The keyboard always plays the Move track whose MIDI In matches the keyboard's
channel. dAVEBOx's Ch knob (which drives sequencer and pad routing) has no effect on
live external MIDI. The user must set their controller to send on the channel
matching the Move track they want to address.

### Recording echo at loop end

When recording is armed and the clip loops back to the beginning, the sequencer
starts playing the recorded notes via DSP inject. Those inject echoes arrive in
`onMidiMessageExternal`. With `isRec = true`, they would be passed to `recordNoteOn`
— recording duplicates every loop, accumulating exponentially until Move freezes.

Fix: `seqActiveNotes.has(d1)` guard before `recordNoteOn`. `seqActiveNotes` is the
JS-polled Set of pitches the sequencer is currently playing on the active track.
If the incoming note-on pitch is already active in the sequencer, it is a playback
echo — skip recording. Known edge case: if the user holds the exact same pitch as
a currently-playing sequencer note, the gate for that keyboard note may be missed.

### Fix: cable-2 channel remap (Schwung v0.9.8+)

Schwung v0.9.8 added `host_ext_midi_remap_set/clear/enable` — the shim rewrites
cable-2 channel bytes in-place before Move processes them. No inject cascade.

dAVEBOx uses `applyExtMidiRemap()` which activates when:
- Active track route = ROUTE_MOVE
- MIDI In = All (channel 0)

All 16 input channels are remapped to the active track's Ch knob value.
When MIDI In is set to a specific channel, remap is disabled — the user has
chosen explicit routing and the JS filter handles it with the original channel.

Shim auto-clears the remap table on overtake exit.

**THRU bypass**: the shim skips remap entirely if any chain slot has
`forward_channel = THRU (-2)`, which is the default for new Schwung slots.
Slots must be set to AUTO (-1) or a specific channel for remap to function.
This is a Schwung-level default issue — not something dAVEBOx can control.

---

## 13. (Historical) Cable-2 MIDI Channel Remapping Spec

Implemented in Schwung v0.9.8 as `host_ext_midi_remap_set/clear/enable`.
See `schwung_ext_midi_remap_t` in `shadow_constants.h` for the SHM layout.

## 14. LED Message Per-Tick Budget — Excess Messages Silently Dropped

### What's actually happening

There is a per-tick budget on LED messages that reach the hardware. When a single
tick queues more LED writes than the budget allows, the **later** messages in the
tick are silently dropped. The exact budget size is unknown, but the threshold sits
somewhere in the 30–48 message range.

`setLED(note, 0)` (a Note On with velocity 0, equivalent to Note Off in MIDI) appears
to be optimized somewhere below `move_midi_internal_send` and consumes either no
budget or far less than a non-zero color message. This makes the ceiling sensitive
to whether you're sending "off" or "color" messages — code that worked with `LED_OFF`
fills the queue when the same call switches to a non-zero color.

### Dual-cache architecture

LED state passes through two independent caches before reaching `move_midi_internal_send`:

1. **`lastSentNoteLED[]`** in `ui.js` — gates `cachedSetLED()`. Cache hit → no call to
   the imported `setLED`.
2. **`ledCache[]`** in `input_filter.mjs` — gates raw `setLED()`. Cache hit → no call
   to `move_midi_internal_send`. `force=true` bypasses this layer only.

Neither cache prevents the per-tick budget from being consumed once a message *does*
go through. The budget enforcement happens below both caches.

`invalidateLEDCache()` clears only `lastSentNoteLED[]`, not `ledCache[]`.

### How this caused the Perf Mode pad LED regression (2026-04-30, fixed in 8372434)

In Perf Mode (Session View + Loop held), the periodic tick was calling both
`updateSceneMapLEDs()` (which writes notes 16–31 with scene colors) and
`updatePerfModeLEDs()` (which writes 16–31 with perf colors *and* 68–99 with mod
colors) — back to back, every tick. The two functions wrote conflicting values for
notes 16–31, so each tick produced ~32 step-button messages plus pad messages.

In Phase 2 the empty preset slots used `setLED(slot, LED_OFF)` (vel=0). The vel=0
messages were optimized below the budget, so the per-tick total stayed under the
ceiling and pad messages reached the hardware. Phase 3's commit 78f190a switched
empty preset slots to `setLED(slot, DarkPurple)` (a non-zero color). Now all 32
step-button messages consumed budget; the pad messages — sent later in the same
tick — were silently dropped. Result: pads kept showing session colors from the
prior tick's `ledCache`, while step buttons and OLED rendered correctly because their
messages came first.

This was a long debug because the symptom (pads stuck on session colors) looked like
caching, ordering, or Move-overrides-the-pad-grid. None of those were the cause —
the real signal was that even `setLED(99, color, true)` (force, raw send) couldn't
move pad 99 when 32 step-button writes had already gone through earlier in the tick.

### Earlier wrong hypothesis (corrected)

A previous version of this section claimed "the framework keeps only the first
message per note per tick." That was wrong — the same-note conflict is irrelevant.
The actual mechanism is a global per-tick budget on the *number* of LED messages,
across all notes.

### The correct pattern

**Don't write the same LED twice from two functions in the same tick.** When a mode
takeover (Perf Mode, etc.) wants to override an LED range that another update path
also writes, call the takeover *instead of* the base update — not after it:

```js
if (loopHeld || perfViewLocked) updatePerfModeLEDs();
else updateSceneMapLEDs();
```

Running both wastes the LED budget on notes that will be overwritten anyway. With
non-zero colors, that waste is enough to lose unrelated messages downstream in the
same tick.

**Secondary rule:** if you need to keep a base path running but also force a takeover
on top of it, give the takeover priority by sending those messages *first* in the
tick. Later messages are the ones at risk of being dropped, not the earlier ones.

## 15. `pfx_send` Is the Playback Pipeline; Stage Order Is Load-Bearing

All note-on and note-off events flow through `pfx_send`. The call order is:

```
NOTE FX → HARMZ → MIDI DLY (queues echoes) → SEQ ARP → Looper capture → Perf Mode apply
```

This order determines what each stage sees:
- The Looper captures the post-ARP, post-effect stream — so looped notes are already
  processed. A new stage inserted *after* looper capture won't be looped.
- Perf Mode runs on looper-emitted events only (`looper_emitting=1`). A new effect
  inserted before the looper capture point would affect both live and looped playback.

Any new DSP playback stage must be deliberately positioned in this chain. Getting the
position wrong produces subtle bugs (notes unaffected by the looper, effects applied
twice, etc.) that are hard to diagnose without knowing the pipeline order.

**`pfx_send` is also called from `set_param` context** (e.g. pad presses). Set-param
context does not release Move synth voices (see §10), so stages that need to send
note-offs on ROUTE_MOVE tracks must defer to `render_block` via a flag.

---

## 16. Re-Entry Guard: Every `pfx_send`-Calling Stage Needs an "Emitting" Flag

Any stage that calls `pfx_send` to emit its output must carry a boolean flag
(`arp_emitting`, `looper_emitting`, etc.) and check it at the top of `pfx_send`:

```c
if (arp.style != 0 && !arp_emitting)  // intercept into arp buffer
    ...
else
    // pass through to next stage / MIDI out
```

Without this guard, the stage's own emitted output re-enters the stage as new input
— infinite re-capture. The SEQ ARP and Looper both use this pattern; any future
playback stage that emits via `pfx_send` must do the same.

---

## 17. Per-Clip Pfx Params Reload on Every Clip Switch

Each clip carries its own `clip_pfx_params_t` (NOTE FX, HARMZ, MIDI DLY, SEQ ARP
params). `pfx_sync_from_clip` is called whenever the active clip changes (launch,
track switch, state load). The live DSP state is overwritten with the clip's stored
params.

**Two consequences**:

1. "Why did my knob value change when I switched clips?" — `pfx_sync_from_clip`
   replaced it with the new clip's stored value. Always the answer.

2. Any new per-clip param must be added to `pfx_sync_from_clip` (DSP) and to
   `refreshPerClipBankParams` (JS). Missing either means the param doesn't reload
   when switching away and back.

JS mirrors per-clip params in `bankParams[t][b][k]`, refreshed via
`tN_cC_pfx_snapshot` on clip/track switch. New per-clip ARP fields must be added to
the `pfx_snapshot` response format and the JS parser (`parsePfxSnapshot`).

---

## 18. Pitch-Transforming Stages Must Track Raw→Emitted for Note-Off Matching

Any DSP stage that changes a note's pitch on note-on must store the mapping from
input pitch to emitted pitch, then look up that mapping on note-off to send the
correct pitch. Sending the original raw pitch on note-off doesn't silence the note
that was actually started — it leaves a stuck voice.

Perf Mode uses `perf_emitted_pitch[track][raw_pitch]` (128-entry per-track table,
`0xFF` = not sounding) for this purpose. On note-on, store
`perf_emitted_pitch[tr][raw] = emitted`. On note-off, look up
`perf_emitted_pitch[tr][raw]`, send that pitch, reset to `0xFF`.

This pattern generalizes to any future pitch effect (transpose, harmonizer, live
tuning shift). Forgetting it produces stuck notes that persist until a panic.

---

## 19. Drum Lane DSP Reads Are Active-Clip-Implicit; Defer After Clip Switch

Melodic clip reads (`tN_cC_steps`, `tN_cC_step_S_notes`, etc.) take an explicit clip
index `C` and can be issued at any time.

Drum lane reads (`tN_lL_steps`, `tN_lL_length`, `tN_lL_note_count`, etc.) have no
clip index — they implicitly read whichever clip is currently active for that track
in the DSP. After calling `tN_launch_clip` to switch the active clip, the DSP hasn't
processed the switch yet (set_param is async). Issuing a drum lane read in the same
tick or the next tick reads stale data from the old clip.

**Fix**: set `pendingDrumResync = 2` after any clip switch on a drum track, and
gate all drum lane reads on `pendingDrumResync == 0`. Two ticks is enough for the
DSP to process `tN_launch_clip` before JS reads back lane state.

The lightweight variant (`pendingDrumLaneResync`) re-reads only the active lane's
steps (3 IPC calls vs full resync), used by per-detent K2/K3 edits while stopped.

---

## 20. State Version Bump Required for Any Structural State Change

State files with `v` < current version are silently deleted on load and the module
starts from scratch with no error or warning. The current version is `v=36`.

Any change that alters the state file format — new persisted field, changed key name,
changed serialization format — requires incrementing the version constant in the DSP
`state_save`/`state_load` handlers. Without a bump, old state files load silently
but may be missing expected fields, producing wrong defaults or undefined behavior.

If the new format is backwards-compatible (new optional fields only), the load
handler can accept both `v=N` and `v=N+1` and write `v=N+1`. If not
backwards-compatible, bump and delete old files.

---

## 21. Opportunities Not Yet Taken

**DSP-side recording** would eliminate the biggest remaining source of JS-mirror
complexity. Currently, live recording timing is computed in JS from polled
`trackCurrentStep` with ~20ms jitter. DSP-side capture via `on_midi` stores
`tick_in_step + current_step` at the exact interrupt, giving sub-block precision.
The JS mirror doesn't need to track timing at all — it just sends the note and the
DSP fills in the timing.

**Dirty flag + background sync** instead of explicit `pendingStepsReread`. A single
`clipsDirty` flag that triggers a full `syncClipsFromDsp` on the next tick would
replace all the ad-hoc deferred re-read variables (`pendingDspSync`,
`pendingStepsReread`). Cost: slightly over-reads; benefit: no more per-operation
confirmation bookkeeping.

**`occ_cache` in render path** — using the 256-bit occupancy bitmap to skip the
full `notes[]` scan for steps with no active note would reduce render CPU when clips
are sparse (the common case early in a session).

**Clip resolution (per-clip TICKS_PER_STEP)** — the absolute-position model in
`notes[]` already supports arbitrary tick positions. Adding a per-clip step size
(1/32 through 1-bar) requires only changing how `current_step` advances and how
the midpoint formula is parameterized. The data model already handles it; the
remaining work is UI + render timing.
